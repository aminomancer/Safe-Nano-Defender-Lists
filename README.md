# Safe-Nano-Defender-Lists  
just safe copies of the filter lists for nano defender. (firefox extra installation steps)  
this is for my personal use but i figured i might as well make it public for others.  
i wanted to clone these lists to hedge against the possibility of the original (currently read-only) repo being hijacked somehow.  
the current controllers of the chrome web store listing are apparently bad actors and i don't know the status of the github repo, so this is a precaution.
